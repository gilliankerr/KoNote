- Qualitative progress data (client words, progress descriptors, engagement)
- Events (intake, follow-ups, referrals, crises)
- Alerts for clients with notable situations
- Custom field values (contact info, emergency contacts, referral sources)
- Demo groups (service, activity, project) with sessions, attendance, and highlights
- Email and staff-sent communications with varied delivery statuses
- Portal content (journal entries, messages, staff notes, correction requests)
- Registration submissions in various review states

This gives charts and reports meaningful data to display.

Run with: python manage.py seed_demo_data
Only runs when DEMO_MODE is enabled.
