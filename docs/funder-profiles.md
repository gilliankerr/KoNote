# Report Templates

Report templates let you define custom demographic breakdowns for reports. Different funders may define age categories differently (e.g. "youth" as 13–24 vs 15–29) or require additional demographic groupings beyond age.

## How It Works

1. **Analyse reporting requirements** — Use a Claude session with your reporting template or guidelines. Ask Claude to generate a report template CSV.
2. **Upload the CSV** — Go to **Settings → Report Templates → Upload New Template**. Upload the CSV file or paste the CSV text directly.
3. **Preview and confirm** — Review the parsed breakdowns and assign the template to the relevant programs.
4. **Use in reports** — When generating a report, select the report template from the dropdown. The report will use the selected age bins and category merges.

## Who Can Do What

| Action | Role |
|---|---|
| Create/edit/delete report templates | Administrator only |
| View and select templates in reports | Executive, Program Manager, Administrator |
| Generate template CSVs | Anyone (outside the app, using Claude) |

## CSV Format

The CSV uses a simple row-type format. Each row starts with a type keyword:

| Row Type | Columns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `profile_name` | name | The template's display name |
| `profile_description` | description | Optional description |
| `breakdown` | label, source_type, [field_name] | Start a new breakdown section. Source type is `age` or `custom_field` |
| `bin` | breakdown_label, min_age, max_age, label | An age bin (only for `age` breakdowns) |
| `merge` | breakdown_label, target_label, "source1,source2,..." | Merge multiple category values into one label |
| `keep_all` | breakdown_label | Use the field's original categories without merging |

### Example CSV

```csv
profile_name,Reporting template
profile_description,Sample report template for Canadian Community Fund quarterly outcomes

breakdown,Age Categories,age
bin,Age Categories,0,14,Child (0-14)
bin,Age Categories,15,24,Youth (15-24)
bin,Age Categories,25,64,Adult (25-64)
bin,Age Categories,65,999,Senior (65+)

breakdown,Employment Status,custom_field,Employment Status
merge,Employment Status,Employed,"Full-time,Part-time,Self-employed,Contract"
merge,Employment Status,Not Employed,"Unemployed,Seeking employment"
merge,Employment Status,Student,"Full-time student,Part-time student"

breakdown,Gender Identity,custom_field,Gender Identity
keep_all,Gender Identity
```

## Default Profile

KoNote includes a **Standard Canadian Nonprofit** default profile with these age categories:

- Child (0–12)
- Youth (13–17)
- Young Adult (18–24)
- Adult (25–64)
- Senior (65+)

To create this default, run: `python manage.py seed_default_funder_profile`

In demo mode, the app also seeds a sample template named **Reporting template** with example requirements for **Canadian Community Fund**.

## Tips

- **Use Claude to generate CSVs** — Provide your funder's reporting template and ask Claude to produce the CSV. This avoids manual formatting errors.
- **One template per reporting format** — Create separate templates where requirements differ.
- **Assign to programs** — A template must be linked to at least one program to appear in report forms.
- **Download and re-upload** — You can download a template's CSV from the detail page, edit it, and upload as a new template.

## Privacy Safeguards

Report templates control how aggregate data is grouped — they do not expose individual client data. The reporting system enforces these safeguards regardless of template configuration:

- **Confidential programs** — No demographic grouping is allowed.
- **Small programs** — Programs with fewer than 50 enrolled clients cannot use demographic grouping.
- **Small-cell suppression** — Groups with fewer than 10 individuals are suppressed (shown as "< 10").
- **PII fields blocked** — Fields like Preferred Name, Postal Code, and Emergency Contact are never available for grouping, even in legacy mode.
